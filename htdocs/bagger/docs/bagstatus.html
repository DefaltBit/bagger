      <div id="content">
        <p>From the BagIt specification: A bag is considered complete if every file in every payload manifest and tag manifest is present, and if every payload file appears in at least one payload manifest. A payload file does not need to appear in every payload manifest as long as it appears in one payload manifest (i.e., it must belong to the "union" of payload manifests). In a complete bag containing one or more tag manifests, any tag file may appear in zero or more of those manifests, but every tag file appearing in any tag manifest must be present in the bag.</p>

      <div id="content">
		<ul>Basic flow:<br/>
		   <li>1. User selects to check that a bag is complete.<br/></li>
		   <li>2. Application checks that a bag is complete.<br/></li>
		   <li>3. If a Project profile has been selected, application checks that it has been satisfied.<br/></li>
		   <li>4. Application updates the displayed information with the result, including warning about any unsatisfied fields from Project profile.<br/></li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Note: A user may want to check that a bag is complete instead of verifying a bag because it is less time-consuming.</li>
		</ul>

      <div id="content">
        <p>In order to check for a bag’s completeness, the bag must first be saved.  Once the bag is saved to disk, the ‘Check is Complete’ button will be enabled.  Select the ‘Check is Complete’ button.</p>

	    <img src="images/bagger_iscomplete_dialog.jpg" alt="Check is complete" />

	    <p>When a bag is complete, the ‘Is Complete Dialog’ pops up with the message: ‘Bag is complete.’ </p>

      <div id="content">
	    <p>
	    <img src="images/bagger_iscomplete_incomplete.jpg" alt="Warning incomplete" />
	    </p>
	    <p>If a bag is not complete, a ‘Warning - incomplete’ popup dialog will appear and display the problem causing the bag to be incomplete.  In this example, there is a file in the data payload called ‘robots.txt’ which is not found in the ‘manifest-md5.txt’ tag file. </p>

      </div>

    <a name="valid"></a>
      <div id="page_head"><h2>Checking that a bag is valid</h2></div>
        <p>The spec does not require a bag-info.txt at all, let alone the contact information.
		A bag is considered valid if it is complete and if each CHECKSUM in every payload manifest and tag manifest can be verified against the contents of its corresponding FILENAME.
		Note that tag files (including tag manifest files) can be added to or removed from a bag without impacting the completeness or validity of the bag as long as the tag files do not appear in a tag manifest. </p>

      <div id="content">
        <p>In order to check for a bag’s validity, the bag must first be saved.  Once the bag is saved to disk, the ‘Check is Valid’ button will be enabled.  Select the ‘Check is Valid’ button.</p>

	    <img src="images/bagger_isvalid_dialog.jpg" alt="Check is valid" />

	    <p>When a bag is valid, the ‘Validation Dialog’ pops up with the message: ‘Validation successful.’ </p>

	    <img src="images/bagger_isvalid_valid.jpg" alt="Bag is valid" />

	    <p>Selecting Ok on the popup dialog displays the bag and both the ‘Is bag complete?’ and ‘Is bag valid?’ state messages will now display ‘yes’.</p>

	    <p>If a bag is not valid, a ‘Warning - validation failure’ popup dialog will appear and display the problem causing the bag to be invalid.  In this case there is a mismatch between the fixity values in the manifest and tag manifest files.  See the BagIt specification for more information about fixity checksums and bag verification.</p>
