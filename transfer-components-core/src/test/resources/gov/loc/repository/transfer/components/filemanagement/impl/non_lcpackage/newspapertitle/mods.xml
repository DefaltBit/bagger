    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;From February 8, 1918, to June 13, 1919, by order of General John J. Pershing, the United States Army published a newspaper for its forces in France, &lt;i&gt;The Stars and Stripes&lt;/i&gt;. This online collection, presented by the Serial and Government Publications Division of the Library of Congress, includes the complete seventy-one-week run of the newspaper's World War I edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;i&gt;The Stars and Stripes&lt;/i&gt; began publication, American forces were dispersed throughout the Western Front, often mixed at the unit level with British, French, and Italian forces. The newspaper's mission was to provide these scattered troops with a sense of unity and an understanding of their part in the overall war effort. The eight-page weekly featured news from home, sports news, poetry, and cartoons, with a staff that included journalists Alexander Woollcott, Harold Ross, and Grantland Rice. Printing the paper on presses borrowed from Paris newspaper plants, the staff used a network of trains, automobiles, and a motorcycle to deliver the news to the doughboys (as the American soldiers were called). At the peak of its production, &lt;i&gt;The Stars and Stripes&lt;/i&gt; had a circulation of 526,000 readers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
